   - PRs merged
   - PRs with significant activity or discussion

2. **Issues**
   - New issues opened
   - Issues closed or resolved
   - Issues with notable updates

3. **Commits**
   - Significant commits to main branch
   - Notable code changes

## Format

Create a discussion post with:
- ðŸ“Š A quick stats summary (X PRs, Y issues, Z commits)
- ðŸŽ¯ Highlights of the most important activity
- ðŸ’¬ Any interesting discussions or decisions
